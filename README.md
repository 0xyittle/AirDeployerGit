# AirDeployer
AirDeployer is a contract deployment tool designed for everyone, including artists. Unlike other deployment tools that often have limitations, AirDeployer aims to break down these barriers.

In the first version, I created a base contract that allows anyone to create Generate art collections , Open editions. Users can set the supply to be limited or unlimited and choose whether the contract should have an end date or be endless.

Since launching the demo website, my artist friends have found it easy to deploy contracts on Superchain using AirDeployer without needing to write any code. We use the ERC721A standard to ensure the best gas fee rates.

Even better, deploying contracts with AirDeployer is free of charge. We have also verified all contracts on every supported chain.

And certainly, in the near future, everyone who deploys contracts using AirDeployer will be able to edit their contracts directly through our website without needing to make changes on Etherscan.
